# Automata

I'm trying to implement various automata, such as:
 - deterministic finite-state automaton
 - non-deterministic finite-state automaton
 - pushdown automaton
 - linear-bounded automaton
 - Turing machine

Right now I am implementing them in Ruby.

One note: Implementing a true Turing machine is impossible with finite memory... I am probably going to model a Turing machine, but of course, during runtime, it can only go as far as the computer's memory system allows it to.
